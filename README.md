For Andrew, due to unfortunate circumstances my work has almost completely corrupted and only leaving Apps 1, 2 & 5 safe.
I am hoping these grant me my 40% for this module but if not I will do a resubmission with the board as soon as I can. 
Again, I am deeply sorry, I did not see this coming until when it came tie to fully upload all the work onto the github.
